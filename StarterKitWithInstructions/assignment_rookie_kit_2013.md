Exercise : Code Camp Rookie Kit 2013
------------------------------------

**Assignment**

The rookie kit is available.  Download it, unpack it,
and start making it into your cool game.

The game design is all yours!  We can't tell you what
makes a game good or bad.  That's up to you.  However,
we can help you with some technical details.  Here are 
a few tutorials that may help you.

**Setup**

You'll need Python and PyGame installed on your system
to run and change the game.  Follow these instructions
to do the setup.

*    [Get Python 2.7.x](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/),
     the latest version of 2.7, 32-bit version.
     (We know what we're talking about.  Don't get a 3.x version
     of Python.  Don't get a 64-bit version of Python, even if your
     operating system is 64-bit, still get a 32-bit version.)

*    [Get the 32-bit version of PyGame for Python 2.7](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).
     Choose based on your operating system version from 
     the list available.

Get Python first, and apply the intaller.  Get PyGame second,
and apply the installer.  Afterwards, try to launch the
starter kit by running `main.py`.  This should test that your
installation is working correctly.
