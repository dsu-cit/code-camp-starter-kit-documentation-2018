Southern Utah Code Camp 2018 Starter Kit
===============================================

**Getting Started**

Check out the [getting started](other/getting_started.md) document for running the game and getting started.

**Description**

We have [a few ideas](other/the_game.md) you may want to consider when deciding what 
features to make in your game.  However, the game design is all yours!  We can't tell you what
makes a game good or bad.  That's up to you.  
We can help you with some technical details.  Here are 
a few tutorials that may help you get started with making changes.
