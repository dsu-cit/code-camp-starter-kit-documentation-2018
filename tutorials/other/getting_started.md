# Getting Started with the Starter Kit

## Running the Game

You start the game by opening *main.py* and running/building the program. It is important that the folders and files stay named the same and are not moved out of their current structure. If you used the installers on the thumbdrive, you can open the `main.py` file with IDLE and then "Run" the program. You can also install and use PyCharm.



### The game

[The game](the_game.md) is a basic side scrolling shooter. Your player spawns on the left side of the screen, and baddies spawn on the right side of the screen.  The baddies move towards the left.  You can move around the left 1/3 of the screen using the arrow keys.  You can shoot bullets with the space bar. 

You can customize the game by changing colors, sizes or numbers of items.  You can add scoring systems, different baddies, a second player, shooting baddies, etc.  Your imagination is the only limit.

Have fun with the Starter Kit. Don't be scared to ask questions or help your neighbors. We want everyone to have a great time at Code Camp.

## The Starter Kit Files

Below is a description of all files in the starter kit. You will do all your customizations in these files, or in newly added new files.

*	`main.py` This is the file to "Run" to play the game.  It is also used to configure the size of the screen, the desired frame rate and the title bar text.
*	`game_program.py` This is the main control for the entire game system. It controls the creation of all items, moving the items, checking for collisions and drawing items.
*	`spaceship.py` This controls the details of the spaceship.
*	`baddie.py` This controls the details of the baddies.
*	`bullet.py` This controls the details of the bullets.
