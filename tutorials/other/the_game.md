# The Starter Kit Game

The game starts as a basic side scrolling shooter. Your player spawns on the left side of the screen, and baddies spawn on the right side of the screen.  The baddies move towards the left.  You can move around the left 1/3 of the screen using the arrow keys.  You can shoot bullets with the space bar. 

### What Can It Become?

The game can become anything you can image and take the time to create.  Brainstorm theme, game play, aesthetics and interaction ideas. Decide with your team what your top priorities should be, and work on them in order.  Be sure to check if your ideas can be completed in a reasonable amount of time.  It's better to finish something that's good, than to not finish something that could be great.

Here are a few ideas that you could work on.

- Change the color of the ship/bullets/baddies
- Change the shape of the ship/bullets/baddies
- Change the ship/bullets/baddies to be images instead of rectangles
- Add a score keeping system.  For example, track the number of baddies killed.  Or the time to kill 50 baddies, etc.
- Display the score.
- Add a lives system.
- Display the number of lives left.
- Subtract a life if a baddie escapes to the left.
- Subtract a life if the ship collides with a baddie.
- End the game when there are no more lives left.
- Allow baddies to move in any direction.
- Let the baddies shoot.
- Add a second player. Maybe it's a friend, maybe it's a foe.
- Organize waves of baddies.
- Give baddies organized patterns.
- You think of something cool.
